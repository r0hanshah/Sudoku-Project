# Sudoku Soul's Like

Inspired by the Dark Souls Games
Used their font and took inspiration from their "YOU DIED" screen


Sudoku Board with 3 varying difficulties

Use your mouse to select the box you want to type in.
The green value in the upper left of the box will be your sketched value and will be changeable.
Once you hit the enter/return key on a box you clicked (shown by the red outline) the number will be
submitted and you will be unable to change the value unless you restart the game.

If you accidentally submitted a box without a value in it, use the reset button to clear
all the cells.
